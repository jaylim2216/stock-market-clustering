## Stock Market Clustering with Enhanced Feature Analysis
This project initially focuses on clustering stocks based on their daily movements, utilizing KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering techniques. The daily movement, calculated as the difference between each stock's opening and closing values, serves as a primary indicator of daily volatility and trend. Initially, this single feature forms the basis of our clustering analysis, providing insights into how stocks behave on a day-to-day basis.

As the project progresses, I expand the analysis by incorporating additional features: the 10-day and 50-day Moving Averages (MA), and trading volume. By clustering stocks using these enriched data sets, the project aims to uncover more complex patterns and relationships. This multi-faceted approach allows for a deeper understanding of stock market dynamics, revealing how stocks group together not just based on daily price changes, but also considering their general trends and market activity. Comparing the results of clustering with just daily movements against clustering with these additional features provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each method, enhancing the overall stock market data analysis.
